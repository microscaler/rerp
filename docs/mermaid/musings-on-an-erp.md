### **Development Order Rationale**
1. **Core Framework**: User management and database architecture
2. **Product Management**: Critical for Sales, Purchase, and Inventory.
3. **CRM + Sales + Purchase**: Early revenue-focused workflows (leads → sales → procurement).
4. **Inventory**: Connects Sales and Purchase for end-to-end logistics.
5. **Accounting**: Required for financial compliance and closing the loop on transactions.
6. **HR & Project Management**: Supports internal operations.
7. **Manufacturing**: Depends on Inventory and Product data.
8. **Customer-Facing Modules (eCommerce, POS, Helpdesk)**: Built after core operations to ensure backend stability.
9. **Extensions**: Finalize ecosystem tools (marketplace, analytics) once core is mature.

### **Key Considerations**
- **Iterative Development**: Release a minimal viable product (MVP) with Sales, CRM, Inventory, and Accounting first.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Prioritize payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- **Scalability**: Design the database and API layer to handle high transaction volumes.
