# Invoice Management

## What It Is

The Invoice Management service is your business's billing engine—the system that creates professional invoices, manages approval workflows, and ensures customers receive accurate, timely bills. It's the invoicing platform that transforms billing from a manual chore into an automated revenue process.

## Why Your Business Needs This
