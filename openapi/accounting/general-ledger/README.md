# General Ledger & Accounting

## What It Is

The General Ledger service is your business's financial foundation—the core accounting system that manages your chart of accounts, processes journal entries, and maintains complete financial records. It's the accounting platform that ensures every transaction is recorded, every entry is balanced, and every report is accurate.

## Why Your Business Needs This
