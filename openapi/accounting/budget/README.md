# Budgeting & Forecasting

## What It Is

The Budgeting service is your business's financial planning engine—the system that creates budgets, tracks actuals, and forecasts future performance. It's the budgeting platform that transforms financial planning from guesswork into strategic decision-making.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Budgeting is painful. Creating budgets takes weeks, tracking actuals is manual, and you can't see how you're performing against plan. Budgets are created once a year and forgotten, actual spending isn't compared to budget, and you're flying blind financially. You're planning in isolation instead of planning with purpose.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Slow Budget Creation**: Creating budgets manually takes weeks and involves multiple spreadsheets
- **No Actual Tracking**: Can't easily compare actual spending to budget
- **Budget Disconnect**: Budgets created but not used for decision-making
- **No Forecasting**: Can't forecast future performance based on trends
- **Budget Approval Chaos**: Budget approval process is manual and slow
- **No Budget Analytics**: Can't see budget performance or identify variances
