# Accounts Payable

## What It Is

The Accounts Payable service is your business's vendor payment engine—the system that manages vendor invoices, processes payments, and ensures you pay the right vendors the right amounts at the right time. It's the AP platform that transforms vendor payment chaos into strategic cash flow management.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Paying vendors is chaotic. Invoices arrive through email, mail, and portals, but there's no central system to manage them. Payments are processed manually, approvals are ad-hoc, and you can't track what you owe. Late payments damage vendor relationships, early payments tie up cash, and duplicate payments waste money.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Invoice Chaos**: Vendor invoices scattered across email, mail, and systems
- **Manual Payment Processing**: Processing payments manually is slow and error-prone
- **No Approval Process**: Payments happen without proper authorization
- **Duplicate Payments**: Same invoices paid twice, money wasted
- **Late Payment Penalties**: Missing payment terms leads to late fees and damaged relationships
- **No AP Visibility**: Can't see what you owe, when it's due, or who approved it
