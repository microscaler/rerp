# Accounts Receivable

## What It Is

The Accounts Receivable service is your business's cash collection engine—the system that manages customer invoices, tracks payments, and ensures you collect what customers owe on time. It's the AR platform that transforms receivables from a collection challenge into a cash flow advantage.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Collecting from customers is difficult. Invoices are sent but payments are late. Follow-ups are manual and inconsistent. You can't see who owes what, when it's due, or who's at risk. Cash flow suffers, bad debt grows, and collection efforts are reactive instead of proactive.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Late Payments**: Customers pay late, cash flow suffers, business operations are impacted
- **Manual Follow-Ups**: Following up on overdue invoices is manual and inconsistent
- **No Payment Visibility**: Can't see which customers have paid, which are overdue, or which are at risk
- **Collection Inefficiency**: Can't prioritize collection efforts or track collection performance
