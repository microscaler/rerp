# Bank Synchronization

## What It Is

The Bank Synchronization service is your business's financial connection hub—the system that imports bank statements, syncs transactions in real-time, and automatically reconciles payments. It's the bank sync platform that transforms manual bank reconciliation into automated financial accuracy.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Bank reconciliation is a nightmare. You manually download statements, import them into spreadsheets, and match transactions line by line. It takes hours every month, errors are common, and you can't see your real-time cash position. You're reconciling in the past instead of managing in the present.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Statement Import**: Downloading and importing bank statements manually is time-consuming
- **Slow Reconciliation**: Matching transactions manually takes hours every month
- **No Real-Time Visibility**: Can't see bank balances or transactions in real-time
- **Reconciliation Errors**: Manual matching leads to errors and missed transactions
- **Multi-Bank Complexity**: Managing multiple bank accounts is chaotic
- **No Transaction Categorization**: Can't automatically categorize transactions
