# Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

## What It Is

The EDI service is your business's digital document exchange platform—the system that handles electronic invoicing, PEPPOL compliance, and document transformation. It's the EDI platform that transforms paper-based processes into digital, automated workflows.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Paper invoices and manual document processing are killing your efficiency. Invoices are printed, mailed, and manually entered. Compliance requirements demand electronic formats, but you're stuck with paper. Government mandates require PEPPOL, but you can't comply. You're processing documents manually instead of processing them digitally.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Paper Invoice Chaos**: Printing, mailing, and manually processing invoices is slow and expensive
- **Compliance Risk**: Can't meet electronic invoicing requirements, face penalties
- **Manual Data Entry**: Manually entering invoice data is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Format Confusion**: Different countries require different EDI formats, compliance is complex
- **No Digital Signatures**: Can't digitally sign documents, authenticity is questioned
