# Fixed Asset Management

## What It Is

The Fixed Asset Management service is your business's asset tracking system—the platform that manages asset acquisition, tracks depreciation, and maintains complete asset records. It's the asset system that ensures you know what you own, what it's worth, and how it's depreciating.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Tracking fixed assets is chaotic. You don't know what assets you own, where they are, or what they're worth. Depreciation is calculated manually, asset disposal is unrecorded, and you can't generate asset reports for auditors. You're managing assets in spreadsheets instead of managing them strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Asset Inventory Unknown**: Can't see what assets you own or where they are
- **Manual Depreciation**: Calculating depreciation manually is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Asset Disposal Chaos**: Assets disposed but not recorded, books don't match reality
- **No Asset Tracking**: Can't track asset location, custodian, or maintenance history
- **Valuation Confusion**: Don't know what assets are worth or how they're valued
- **Compliance Risk**: Can't generate asset reports for auditors or tax purposes
