# Subcontracting Management

## What It Is

The Subcontracting service is your business's outsourced production engine—the system that manages subcontractor relationships, coordinates material transfers, and tracks subcontractor performance. It's the subcontracting platform that transforms outsourced production from manual coordination into strategic supplier partnerships.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing subcontractors is complex and chaotic. You manually create purchase orders, track material transfers in spreadsheets, and can't see subcontractor performance. Materials get lost, deliveries are late, and you don't know if subcontracting is cost-effective. You're outsourcing reactively instead of managing it strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual PO Creation**: Creating purchase orders to subcontractors is manual and slow
- **Material Transfer Chaos**: Tracking material transfers to subcontractors is error-prone
- **No Performance Tracking**: Can't see which subcontractors perform well or deliver on time
- **Cost Unknown**: Don't know subcontracting costs or if it's profitable
- **Delivery Delays**: Subcontractor deliveries are late, customers wait longer
- **No Integration**: Subcontracting doesn't connect to production planning or inventory

## How It Delivers Pain Relief
