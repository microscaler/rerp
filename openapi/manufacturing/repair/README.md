# Repair Management

## What It Is

The Repair Management service is your business's service operations engine—the system that manages product repairs, tracks repair orders, and analyzes repair costs. It's the repair platform that transforms service operations from ad-hoc fixes into strategic, profitable service business.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing repairs is chaotic. Repair requests come through phone and email, repair orders are tracked in spreadsheets, and you can't see repair status or costs. Customers wait longer, repair quality suffers, and you don't know if repairs are profitable. You're fixing products reactively instead of managing service strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Repair Request Chaos**: Repair requests scattered across phone, email, and systems
- **No Repair Tracking**: Can't track repair status or completion
- **Spare Parts Confusion**: Don't know what spare parts are needed or available
- **Cost Unknown**: Don't know repair costs or profitability
- **Customer Frustration**: Customers can't see repair status, support gets overwhelmed
- **No Repair Analytics**: Can't track repair performance or identify issues
