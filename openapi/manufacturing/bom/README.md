# Bill of Materials (BOM)

## What It Is

The Bill of Materials service is your business's product structure engine—the system that manages product recipes, component relationships, and manufacturing configurations. It's the BOM platform that transforms product complexity into structured, manageable manufacturing instructions.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Product structures are complex and chaotic. You can't see what goes into products, how components relate, or what manufacturing steps are required. BOMs are in spreadsheets, versions are lost, and costs are unknown. You're building products blindly instead of building them systematically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **BOM Chaos**: Product structures in spreadsheets, always outdated
- **No Version Control**: Can't track BOM versions or changes
- **Cost Unknown**: Don't know component costs or total product costs
- **Complex Configurations**: Multi-level products with sub-assemblies are unmanageable
- **No Routing Information**: Manufacturing steps and work centers not defined
- **Component Confusion**: Can't see alternative components or substitutes

## How It Delivers Pain Relief

### 📋 **Structured Product Recipes**
Define product structures clearly with components, quantities, and relationships. Products are built systematically, not chaotically.

### 🔄 **Complete Version Control**
Track BOM versions with effective dates and change history. See what changed, when it changed, and why. Never lose BOM history.

### 💰 **Automatic Cost Calculation**
Calculate component costs and total product costs automatically. Know what products cost to make, price them profitably.

### 🏗️ **Multi-Level Support**
Handle complex multi-level BOMs with sub-assemblies and nested structures. Build complex products, manage complexity simply.

### 🔧 **Manufacturing Routing**
Define manufacturing routing with operations, work centers, and time estimates. Production is planned, not improvised.

### 🔄 **Alternative Components**
Support for alternative components and substitute materials. Flexibility without complexity.

### 🎯 **Business Impact**
- **Faster Product Development**: Structured BOMs accelerate product development
- **Improve Accuracy**: Version control eliminates BOM errors
- **Better Costing**: Automatic cost calculation improves pricing
- **Reduce Waste**: Better BOMs reduce material waste
