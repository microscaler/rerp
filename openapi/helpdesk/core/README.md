# Customer Support & Helpdesk

## What It Is

The Helpdesk service is your business's customer support command center—the system that manages support tickets, routes inquiries, and tracks service levels. It's the helpdesk platform that transforms customer support from email chaos into structured, efficient service delivery.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Customer support is chaotic and inefficient. Support requests come through email, phone, and chat, but there's no central system. Tickets get lost, responses are slow, and customers are frustrated. Support teams are overwhelmed, SLAs are missed, and satisfaction suffers. You're supporting customers reactively instead of supporting them strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Request Chaos**: Support requests scattered across email, phone, and chat
- **No Ticket Tracking**: Can't track support requests or see status
- **Slow Responses**: Responses are slow, customers wait, satisfaction drops
- **SLA Misses**: Service level agreements are missed, customers are unhappy
- **No Support Analytics**: Can't see support performance or identify issues
- **Team Overwhelm**: Support teams are overwhelmed, can't prioritize effectively
