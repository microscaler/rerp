# Knowledge Base & Self-Service

## What It Is

The Knowledge Base service is your business's self-service support engine—the system that provides searchable documentation, AI-powered answers, and customer self-service. It's the knowledge platform that transforms support from reactive tickets into proactive customer empowerment.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Customers ask the same questions repeatedly, support teams answer the same questions over and over, and knowledge is trapped in support agents' heads. Support is expensive, customers wait, and satisfaction suffers. You're answering questions reactively instead of enabling customers proactively.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Repeated Questions**: Same questions asked repeatedly, support teams waste time
- **Knowledge Trapped**: Knowledge exists only in support agents' heads
- **No Self-Service**: Customers can't find answers, must contact support
