# Subscription Management

## What It Is

The Subscription Management service is your business's recurring revenue engine—the system that manages subscription plans, processes recurring billing, and handles the complete subscription lifecycle. It's the subscription platform that transforms one-time sales into predictable, recurring revenue streams.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing subscriptions is complex. Customers sign up, but renewals are manual, upgrades are chaotic, and cancellations are lost. You can't track subscription health, can't predict churn, and can't optimize pricing. Recurring revenue is supposed to be predictable, but yours is unpredictable.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Renewals**: Renewals processed manually, customers get missed, revenue is lost
- **Upgrade/Downgrade Chaos**: Plan changes require manual intervention, errors are common
- **Churn Mystery**: Can't see why customers cancel or predict who will churn
- **Billing Errors**: Recurring invoices generated incorrectly, payments fail silently
- **No Subscription Analytics**: Can't track MRR, churn rate, or subscription health
- **Customer Confusion**: Customers can't see subscription status or manage their plans
