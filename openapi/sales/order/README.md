# Sales Order Management

## What It Is

The Sales Order Management service is your business's order fulfillment engine—the system that processes orders, coordinates fulfillment, and tracks delivery from placement to customer receipt. It's the order platform that ensures every order is processed correctly, fulfilled on time, and delivered as promised.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Order processing is chaotic. Orders come in through multiple channels, but there's no central system to manage them. Inventory checks are manual, shipping coordination is ad-hoc, and customers can't track their orders. Orders get lost, items ship incorrectly, and customers are frustrated. You're processing orders in chaos instead of processing them efficiently.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Order Chaos**: Orders scattered across systems, no central management
- **Manual Inventory Checks**: Sales teams manually check if items are in stock
- **Shipping Delays**: Can't coordinate shipping efficiently, customers wait longer
- **No Order Tracking**: Customers can't see order status, support gets overwhelmed
- **Fulfillment Errors**: Wrong items ship, quantities are incorrect, orders are incomplete
- **No Integration**: Orders don't connect to inventory, shipping, or accounting automatically
