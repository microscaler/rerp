# Quotation Management

## What It Is

The Quotation Management service is your business's professional proposal engine—the system that creates compelling quotes, manages approval workflows, and converts opportunities into orders. It's the quotation platform that makes your sales team look professional, respond faster, and close more deals.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Creating quotes is a nightmare. Sales reps spend hours copying data from spreadsheets, calculating prices manually, and formatting documents. Quotes get sent with wrong prices, outdated product information, or missing terms. Approval workflows are chaotic, and you can't track which quotes are winning or losing. You're losing deals to competitors who respond faster.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Slow Quote Creation**: Hours spent creating quotes manually from spreadsheets and templates
- **Pricing Errors**: Manual calculations lead to wrong prices, lost margins, or lost deals
- **Outdated Information**: Quotes sent with discontinued products or old pricing
- **Approval Chaos**: No clear approval process, quotes stuck waiting for approval
- **No Tracking**: Can't see which quotes are pending, which are approved, or which converted
- **Unprofessional Appearance**: Inconsistent formatting makes your business look unprofessional
