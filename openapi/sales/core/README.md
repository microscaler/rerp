# Sales Orchestration

## What It Is

The Sales Orchestration service is your business's sales command center—the unified system that coordinates quotations, orders, and sales workflows across your entire organization. It's the intelligent sales engine that connects your CRM, inventory, manufacturing, and projects into one seamless sales process.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your sales process is fragmented. Quotations are created in one system, orders in another, inventory checks happen separately, and manufacturing coordination is manual. Sales teams waste time switching between systems, information gets lost, and customers experience delays. You're selling in silos instead of selling as a team.

**The Pain Points**:
- **System Fragmentation**: Sales data scattered across multiple systems with no coordination
- **Manual Coordination**: Sales teams manually check inventory, coordinate with manufacturing, and update projects
- **Information Delays**: Can't give customers accurate delivery dates because systems don't talk to each other
- **Process Inconsistency**: Every sales rep handles orders differently, no standardized process
- **Lost Opportunities**: Complex orders get delayed because coordination is manual
- **No Visibility**: Can't see the full sales picture across channels, teams, and systems
