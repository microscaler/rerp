# Project Management

## What It Is

The Project Management service is your business's delivery orchestration engine—the system that manages projects, tracks tasks, and coordinates resources to deliver on time and on budget. It's the project platform that transforms project chaos into structured, successful delivery.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing projects is chaotic. Tasks are tracked in spreadsheets, resources are allocated manually, and you can't see project status or budgets. Projects run over budget, miss deadlines, and teams are frustrated. You're delivering projects reactively instead of managing them strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Task Tracking Chaos**: Tasks tracked in spreadsheets, status is unknown
- **No Resource Visibility**: Can't see who's working on what or resource availability
- **Budget Overruns**: Projects exceed budgets, can't track spending
- **Missed Deadlines**: Projects miss deadlines, customers are frustrated
