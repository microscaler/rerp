# Timesheet Management

## What It Is

The Timesheet service is your business's time intelligence system—the platform that tracks time spent on projects, tasks, and activities. It's the timesheet system that transforms time tracking from manual timesheets into automated, accurate billing and project management.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Tracking time is manual and inaccurate. Employees fill out timesheets that are often wrong, time isn't billed correctly, and you can't see how time is spent. Projects are unprofitable because time isn't tracked, billing is inaccurate, and productivity is unknown. You're tracking time manually instead of tracking it automatically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Timesheets**: Employees fill out timesheets manually, errors are common
- **No Billing Integration**: Time tracked but not billed, revenue is lost
- **Project Cost Unknown**: Can't see how much time projects consume, profitability is unknown
- **No Time Visibility**: Can't see how employees spend time or identify productivity issues
- **Approval Chaos**: Timesheet approval is manual and slow
- **No Time Analytics**: Can't track time utilization or billing efficiency
