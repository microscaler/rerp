# Business Reporting

## What It Is

The Reporting service is your business's information delivery engine—the system that generates standard and custom reports across all modules with scheduling, distribution, and export capabilities. It's the reporting platform that transforms data into actionable business information.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Generating reports is time-consuming and manual. You pull data from different systems, calculate totals in spreadsheets, and format documents manually. Reports take days to create, are often wrong, and by the time they're ready, data is outdated. You're reporting on history instead of informing decisions.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Report Creation**: Pulling data manually from multiple systems takes days
- **Report Errors**: Manual calculations lead to errors and inconsistencies
- **Outdated Information**: Reports take so long that data is stale
- **No Customization**: Can't create custom reports for specific business needs
- **No Scheduling**: Reports generated manually, not automatically
- **Limited Distribution**: Reports shared manually, stakeholders don't get information timely
