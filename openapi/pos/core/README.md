# Point of Sale (POS)

## What It Is

The Point of Sale service is your business's retail operations engine—the system that processes sales transactions, manages orders, and handles payments at physical locations. It's the POS platform that transforms retail operations from cash register limitations into powerful, integrated sales systems.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your point of sale is limited and disconnected. Cash registers are basic, inventory isn't synced, and you can't see sales in real-time. Restaurant table management is manual, orders get lost, and customer experience suffers. You're selling with limitations instead of selling with power.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Basic Cash Registers**: Limited functionality, can't integrate with other systems
- **No Real-Time Inventory**: Can't see inventory in real-time, sell out-of-stock items
- **Manual Table Management**: Restaurant table management is manual and error-prone
- **No Offline Capability**: System goes down, sales stop, revenue is lost
- **Limited Payment Options**: Limited payment methods reduce sales
- **No Sales Analytics**: Can't see sales performance or identify trends
