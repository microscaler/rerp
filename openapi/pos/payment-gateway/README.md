# Payment Gateway Integration

## What It Is

The Payment Gateway service is your business's financial transaction hub—the system that integrates with 20+ payment providers to process payments securely, handle refunds, and reconcile transactions. It's the payment platform that transforms payment processing from complexity into simplicity.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Accepting payments is complicated and risky. Each payment provider has different APIs, security requirements are complex, and reconciliation is manual. Payment failures are common, refunds are chaotic, and you can't see payment performance. You're processing payments reactively instead of processing them strategically.

- **Multiple Payment Providers**: Managing multiple payment providers is complex
- **Security Complexity**: PCI compliance and security requirements are overwhelming
- **Payment Failures**: Payment failures are common, can't see why or fix them
- **Manual Reconciliation**: Reconciling payments manually is time-consuming and error-prone
