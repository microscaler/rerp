# Approval Workflows

## What It Is

The Approvals service is your business's authorization engine—the platform that manages multi-level approval processes for purchases, expenses, and other business transactions. It's the approval platform that transforms authorization chaos into structured, efficient workflows.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Getting approvals is slow and chaotic. Approval requests are sent via email, responses are lost, and you can't track approval status. Approvals take days, business slows down, and decisions are delayed. You're approving manually instead of approving efficiently.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Email Approval Chaos**: Approval requests sent via email, responses get lost
- **Slow Approvals**: Approvals take days, business decisions are delayed
- **No Approval Tracking**: Can't see approval status or who approved what
- **Approval Bottlenecks**: Approvals stuck waiting, business processes stall
- **No Delegation**: Approvers unavailable, approvals delayed
- **No Audit Trail**: Can't prove who approved what or when
