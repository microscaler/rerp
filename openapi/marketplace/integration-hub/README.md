# Integration Hub

## What It Is

The Integration Hub service is your business's connection center—the platform that provides pre-built connectors for Google, Microsoft, and other popular services. It's the integration hub that transforms your ERP from an isolated system into a connected business ecosystem.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Connecting to external services is complex and time-consuming. Each service has different APIs, authentication is complicated, and data mapping is manual. Integrations take months to build, break when services change, and require constant maintenance. You're integrating manually instead of integrating automatically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Complex Integrations**: Building integrations requires technical expertise and time
- **Multiple APIs**: Each service has different APIs and authentication methods
- **Data Mapping Complexity**: Mapping data between systems is manual and error-prone
- **Integration Maintenance**: Integrations break when services change, require constant updates
- **No Pre-Built Connectors**: Must build every integration from scratch
- **Integration Failures**: Integrations fail silently, data doesn't sync, business suffers
