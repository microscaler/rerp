# Vendor & Supplier Management

## What It Is

The Vendor Management service is your business's supplier relationship engine—the system that manages vendor profiles, tracks performance, and ensures you work with the best suppliers. It's the vendor platform that transforms supplier relationships from transactions into strategic partnerships.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your vendor relationships are fragmented. You can't track which vendors perform well, which cost less, or which deliver on time. Vendor information is scattered, performance isn't measured, and you're making procurement decisions without data. You're working with vendors, not managing them.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Vendor Information Scattered**: Vendor data in spreadsheets, emails, and memory
- **No Performance Tracking**: Can't see which vendors deliver on time or meet quality standards
- **Price Comparison Impossible**: Can't compare prices across vendors for the same items
- **Vendor Onboarding Chaos**: New vendor setup is manual, slow, and error-prone
- **No Vendor Portal**: Vendors can't access their POs or update information easily
- **Relationship Management Missing**: Can't track vendor history, contracts, or relationships
