# Purchase Order Management

## What It Is

The Purchase Order Management service is your business's procurement engine—the system that manages vendor purchases, coordinates approvals, and ensures you buy the right products at the right prices from the right suppliers. It's the purchase platform that transforms chaotic buying into strategic procurement.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your purchasing is disorganized. Employees buy from different vendors, prices are inconsistent, and there's no approval process. You're overspending, buying from unapproved vendors, and can't track what you've ordered. Procurement is a cost center instead of a strategic advantage.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Uncontrolled Spending**: Employees buy from anywhere, no centralized control
- **Price Inconsistency**: Same items cost different prices from different vendors
- **No Approval Process**: Purchases happen without oversight, budgets are exceeded
- **Vendor Chaos**: Can't track which vendors you use, which perform well, or which cost less
- **Receipt Confusion**: Goods arrive but receipts don't match orders
