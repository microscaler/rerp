# Product Catalog

## What It Is

The Product Catalog service is your business's digital product library—the single source of truth for everything you sell. It's the comprehensive product information management system that powers your sales, marketing, e-commerce, and inventory systems with accurate, up-to-date product data.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your product information is scattered across spreadsheets, websites, catalogs, and systems. Sales teams use outdated pricing. Marketing promotes discontinued products. E-commerce shows wrong inventory. Every department has a different version of the truth, and customers pay the price.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Data Chaos**: Product information in 10 different places, never matching
- **Outdated Information**: Sales teams quoting prices from last year's spreadsheet
- **Inventory Disconnects**: Website shows "in stock" but warehouse is empty
- **Manual Updates**: Changing a product description means updating 5 different systems
- **Lost Sales**: Customers can't find products because they're not properly categorized
- **Compliance Risk**: Selling expired products or products with incorrect specifications
