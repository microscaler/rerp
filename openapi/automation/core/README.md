# Workflow Automation

## What It Is

The Automation service is your business's process orchestration engine—the platform that provides rule-based automation, workflow orchestration, and automated business process execution across all modules. It's the automation platform that transforms manual processes into intelligent, automated workflows.

## Why Your Business Needs This

Employees waste time on repetitive tasks, customers wait longer, and productivity suffers. You're operating manually instead of operating automatically.

- **Process Inconsistency**: Processes handled differently by different people
- **Slow Execution**: Manual processes are slow, customers wait, business suffers
