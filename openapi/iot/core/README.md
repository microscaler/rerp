# IoT Integration & Device Management

## What It Is

The IoT service is your business's connected device engine—the platform that integrates with IoT devices for data collection, real-time monitoring, and automation in manufacturing, logistics, and field service. It's the IoT platform that transforms physical operations into intelligent, data-driven processes.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your physical operations are disconnected and unmonitored. Manufacturing equipment, warehouse sensors, and field devices generate data, but you can't collect it or use it. Operations are reactive, problems are discovered too late, and efficiency suffers. You're operating blindly instead of operating intelligently.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Device Disconnection**: IoT devices not connected to business systems
- **Data Uncollected**: Device data not collected or analyzed
- **Reactive Operations**: Problems discovered after they occur, not before
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Can't monitor operations in real-time
- **Manual Data Collection**: Collecting device data manually is time-consuming
- **No Automation**: Can't automate based on device data or conditions
