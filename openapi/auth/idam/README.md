# Identity & Access Management (IDAM)

## What It Is

The Identity & Access Management service is your enterprise's secure entry point, providing unified authentication and user management across all RERP systems. Think of it as the master key system for your entire business platform—one login, multiple methods, complete control.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your business is drowning in password chaos. Employees juggle multiple logins, forget passwords constantly, and security breaches happen because authentication is fragmented across systems. You're spending IT resources on password resets instead of innovation.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Password Fatigue**: Employees manage 10+ different passwords, leading to security shortcuts
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Weak passwords, shared credentials, and no centralized security policy
- **IT Overhead**: Help desk overwhelmed with password reset requests
- **Compliance Risk**: No unified audit trail of who accessed what and when
- **User Frustration**: Locked accounts, forgotten passwords, and slow access to critical systems

## How It Delivers Pain Relief

### 🔐 **One Identity, Everywhere**
Your employees log in once and access everything they need. No more password juggling, no more "which system was that again?" moments. Single Sign-On (SSO) means productivity soars and frustration plummets.

### 🛡️ **Enterprise-Grade Security**
Support for modern authentication methods including:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Protect accounts with TOTP, SMS, or hardware keys
- **Passwordless Options**: WebAuthn/Passkeys for frictionless, secure access
- **LDAP/Active Directory Integration**: Connect to your existing corporate directory
- **OAuth 2.0/OIDC**: Secure integration with third-party applications

### ⚡ **Zero IT Friction**
Automated password policies, self-service password resets, and intelligent session management mean your IT team stops being a password help desk and starts being strategic enablers.

### 📊 **Complete Visibility**
Every login, every access attempt, every security event is logged and auditable. When compliance auditors ask "who accessed what?", you have the answer instantly.

### 🎯 **Business Impact**
- **Reduce IT Support Costs**: 70% reduction in password-related help desk tickets
- **Improve Security Posture**: Centralized security policies and MFA adoption
- **Boost Productivity**: Employees spend less time logging in, more time working
- **Ensure Compliance**: Complete audit trails for regulatory requirements

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Method Authentication**: LDAP, OAuth, Passkeys, TOTP, traditional passwords
- **Session Management**: Secure sessions with configurable timeouts and refresh tokens
- **User Lifecycle**: Registration, verification, password reset, account management
- **Security Features**: Brute-force protection, account lockout, password complexity
