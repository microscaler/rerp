# Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

## What It Is

The CRM service is your business's customer intelligence center—the system that tracks every interaction, manages every opportunity, and turns leads into loyal customers. It's the complete customer relationship management platform that gives your sales team the insights they need to close more deals, faster.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your sales team is flying blind. Leads come in through email, phone, website, and trade shows, but there's no central place to track them. Opportunities get lost in spreadsheets. Follow-ups are forgotten. You can't tell which marketing campaigns are working or which sales activities are closing deals. Revenue leaks through the cracks.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Lost Leads**: Leads come in but get forgotten in email inboxes and sticky notes
- **No Pipeline Visibility**: Can't see where deals are stuck or which opportunities are at risk
- **Manual Tracking**: Sales teams spend more time updating spreadsheets than talking to customers
- **No Follow-Up System**: Important follow-ups get missed, deals go cold
- **Marketing Disconnect**: Can't connect marketing activities to actual sales results
- **Forecasting Guesswork**: Revenue forecasts are based on gut feel, not data
