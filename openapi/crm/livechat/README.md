# Live Chat

## What It Is

The Live Chat service is your business's 24/7 customer engagement engine—the system that connects website visitors with your team in real-time, captures leads automatically, and turns browsers into buyers. It's the live chat platform that provides instant support, answers questions, and converts visitors into customers.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Website visitors have questions, but they're not picking up the phone or filling out contact forms. They're leaving your site without engaging. You're losing potential customers because they can't get instant answers. Your sales team can't be everywhere, but your website needs to be.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Lost Website Visitors**: Visitors leave without engaging because they can't get instant answers
- **No Real-Time Engagement**: Can't connect with visitors when they're most interested

- **Support Overload**: Phone and email support overwhelmed, can't handle website inquiries
