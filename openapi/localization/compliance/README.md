# Regulatory Compliance Management

## What It Is

The Compliance service is your business's regulatory protection system—the platform that manages regulatory compliance, audit trails, data retention policies, and country-specific legal requirements. It's the compliance platform that transforms regulatory risk from a business threat into managed, controlled operations.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Regulatory compliance is complex and risky. GDPR, CCPA, SOX, and other regulations require specific controls, but you can't prove compliance. Audit trails are missing, data retention is unmanaged, and you face penalties for non-compliance. You're operating at risk instead of operating with confidence.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Compliance Complexity**: Multiple regulations (GDPR, CCPA, SOX) with different requirements
- **No Audit Trails**: Can't prove who accessed what data or when
- **Data Retention Chaos**: Don't know what data to retain, when to delete, or how to archive
- **Access Logging Missing**: Can't log data access for compliance audits
- **Compliance Reporting**: Can't generate compliance reports for auditors
- **Regulatory Risk**: Non-compliance leads to penalties, fines, and reputation damage
