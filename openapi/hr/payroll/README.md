# Payroll Processing

## What It Is

The Payroll service is your business's compensation engine—the system that processes salary calculations, manages deductions, and generates payslips. It's the payroll platform that transforms payroll from a monthly nightmare into an automated, accurate process.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Processing payroll is complex and error-prone. Salary calculations are manual, tax deductions are confusing, and payslips are generated in spreadsheets. Payroll takes days every month, errors are common, and employees complain about wrong paychecks. You're processing payroll in chaos instead of processing it with confidence.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Calculations**: Calculating salaries, taxes, and deductions manually is slow and error-prone
- **Tax Complexity**: Tax calculations are complex, especially for multiple countries
- **Payslip Generation**: Generating payslips manually takes hours
