# Leave Management

## What It Is

The Leave Management service is your business's absence management system—the platform that handles leave requests, manages approval workflows, and tracks leave balances. It's the leave system that transforms absence management from email chaos into structured, automated processes.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing employee leave is chaotic. Leave requests come through email, approvals are ad-hoc, and leave balances are tracked in spreadsheets. Employees don't know their balances, managers can't see team availability, and payroll deductions are wrong. You're managing leave in chaos instead of managing it strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Email Leave Requests**: Leave requests scattered across email, no central system
- **Manual Balance Tracking**: Leave balances tracked in spreadsheets, always wrong
- **No Approval Process**: Leave approvals are ad-hoc, inconsistent, and slow
- **Employee Confusion**: Employees don't know their leave balances or available days
- **Payroll Errors**: Leave deductions calculated incorrectly, disputes are frequent
- **No Visibility**: Can't see team availability or plan around absences
