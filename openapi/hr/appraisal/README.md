# Performance Appraisal

## What It Is

The Performance Appraisal service is your business's talent development engine—the system that manages performance reviews, tracks goals, and facilitates 360-degree feedback. It's the appraisal platform that transforms performance management from annual anxiety into continuous development.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Performance reviews are dreaded. They happen once a year, are based on memory, and don't drive improvement. Goals are set but forgotten, feedback is inconsistent, and employees don't know how they're performing. You're managing performance reactively instead of developing it proactively.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Annual Review Anxiety**: Once-a-year reviews are stressful and based on recent memory
- **No Goal Tracking**: Goals set but not tracked, forgotten until review time
- **Inconsistent Feedback**: Feedback is ad-hoc and inconsistent
- **No Development Focus**: Reviews focus on past performance, not future development
- **Manager Bias**: Reviews are subjective, biased, and don't reflect true performance
- **No Performance History**: Can't see performance trends or development over time
