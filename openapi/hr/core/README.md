# Human Resources (HR) Core

## What It Is

The HR Core service is your business's people management foundation—the system that manages employee records, organizational structure, and the complete employee lifecycle. It's the HR platform that transforms employee administration from paperwork into strategic people management.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Pain Points**:
- **Employee Data Scattered**: Employee information in multiple places, never matching
