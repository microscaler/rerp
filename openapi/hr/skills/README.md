# Skills Management

## What It Is

The Skills Management service is your business's talent intelligence system—the platform that tracks employee skills, identifies skill gaps, and matches skills to opportunities. It's the skills platform that transforms workforce planning from guesswork into strategic talent optimization.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: You don't know what skills your employees have or what skills you need. Hiring is based on resumes, not verified skills. Internal mobility is limited because you can't match skills to opportunities. Training is unfocused because you don't know skill gaps. You're managing talent blindly instead of managing it strategically.
