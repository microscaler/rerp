# Recruitment & Talent Acquisition

## What It Is

The Recruitment service is your business's talent acquisition engine—the system that manages job postings, tracks applicants, and streamlines hiring from application to onboarding. It's the recruitment platform that transforms hiring from a chaotic process into a strategic talent pipeline.

## Why Your Business Needs This
