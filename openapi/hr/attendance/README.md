# Attendance Tracking

## What It Is

The Attendance Tracking service is your business's time monitoring system—the platform that tracks employee clock in/out, calculates work hours, and manages overtime. It's the attendance system that transforms time tracking from manual timesheets into automated workforce management.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Tracking employee attendance is manual and inaccurate. Employees fill out timesheets that are often wrong, overtime is calculated incorrectly, and you can't see who's working when. Payroll is based on inaccurate data, compliance is at risk, and productivity suffers.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Timesheets**: Employees fill out timesheets manually, errors are common
- **Overtime Confusion**: Overtime calculated incorrectly, disputes are frequent
- **No Real-Time Visibility**: Can't see who's working, who's absent, or attendance patterns
- **Compliance Risk**: Can't prove compliance with labor laws or track work hours accurately
- **Payroll Errors**: Inaccurate attendance data leads to payroll mistakes
