# Field Service Management

## What It Is

The Field Service service is your business's mobile workforce engine—the system that schedules technicians, dispatches work orders, and optimizes routes for on-site service delivery. It's the field service platform that transforms mobile service from manual coordination into efficient, profitable operations.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Managing field service is chaotic and inefficient. Work orders are tracked in spreadsheets, technicians are dispatched manually, and you can't see where technicians are or when they'll arrive. Customers wait longer, routes are inefficient, and service costs are high. You're servicing customers reactively instead of servicing them strategically.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Scheduling**: Scheduling technicians manually is time-consuming and inefficient
- **No Technician Visibility**: Can't see where technicians are or when they'll arrive
- **Inefficient Routes**: Routes aren't optimized, technicians waste time driving
- **No Real-Time Updates**: Can't update customers on technician ETA or service status
- **Work Order Chaos**: Work orders tracked in spreadsheets, information gets lost
- **No Performance Tracking**: Can't see technician performance or service quality
