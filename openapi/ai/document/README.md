# Document AI & Intelligent Extraction

## What It Is

The Document AI service is your business's intelligent document processor—the system that uses machine learning to extract data from documents, process invoices, and classify content automatically. It's the document AI platform that transforms paper documents into digital, actionable data.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Processing documents is manual and error-prone. Invoices are entered manually, data extraction is slow, and errors are common. Paper documents pile up, processing takes days, and accuracy suffers. You're processing documents manually instead of processing them intelligently.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Data Entry**: Entering data from invoices and documents manually is slow and error-prone
- **Paper Document Chaos**: Paper documents pile up, processing is delayed
- **OCR Limitations**: Basic OCR doesn't extract structured data effectively
- **Invoice Processing Delays**: Invoice processing takes days, payments are delayed
- **Classification Errors**: Documents classified incorrectly, routed to wrong departments
- **No Learning**: System doesn't learn from corrections, errors repeat
