# E-Commerce Platform

## What It Is

The E-Commerce service is your business's online store engine—the system that powers your online sales with product catalogs, shopping carts, and seamless checkout. It's the e-commerce platform that transforms your website into a revenue-generating online store.

## Why Your Business Needs This
