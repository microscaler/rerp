# Inventory Management

## What It Is

The Inventory Management service is your business's stock intelligence system—the platform that tracks every item, monitors every movement, and ensures you have the right products in the right quantities at the right time. It's the inventory system that transforms stock chaos into supply chain excellence.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: Your inventory is a black box. You don't know what you have, where it is, or how much it's worth. Stockouts lose sales, overstock ties up cash, and inventory counts are always wrong. You're managing inventory by guesswork instead of by data.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Stockout Chaos**: Out-of-stock items lose sales and frustrate customers
- **Overstock Problems**: Too much inventory ties up cash and warehouse space
- **Inventory Inaccuracy**: Physical counts never match system records
- **No Real-Time Visibility**: Can't see stock levels across locations in real-time
- **Valuation Confusion**: Don't know what inventory is worth or how costs are calculated
- **Movement Tracking Missing**: Can't track where inventory goes or why it moves
