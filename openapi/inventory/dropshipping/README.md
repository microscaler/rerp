# Dropshipping Management

## What It Is

The Dropshipping Management service is your business's vendor fulfillment engine—the system that manages dropship orders, automatically creates purchase orders to vendors, and tracks fulfillment from vendor to customer. It's the dropshipping platform that lets you sell products you don't stock, expanding your catalog without expanding your warehouse.

## Why Your Business Needs This

**The Problem**: You want to offer more products, but warehouse space and inventory investment limit your catalog. Dropshipping could solve this, but managing vendor orders manually is chaotic. Orders get lost, vendors aren't notified, and customers wait longer. You're missing sales opportunities because dropshipping is too complicated.

**The Pain Points**:
- **Manual Vendor Orders**: Creating purchase orders to vendors for dropship orders is manual and slow
- **No Fulfillment Tracking**: Can't track when vendors ship or when customers receive dropship orders
- **Vendor Communication Chaos**: Manually sending order details to vendors is error-prone
- **Inventory Confusion**: Can't distinguish between stocked items and dropship items
- **Customer Experience Issues**: Dropship orders take longer, customers don't understand why
- **No Dropship Analytics**: Can't see dropship performance, vendor fulfillment times, or profitability
